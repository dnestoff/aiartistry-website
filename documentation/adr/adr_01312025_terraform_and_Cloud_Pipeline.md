### Title
Implementation of Terraform for AWS Infrastructure and CI/CD Pipeline

### Status
Accepted

### Context
The current infrastructure setup for our project requires a scalable solution to manage AWS deployments efficiently. We are facing challenges with manual provisioning and configuration of resources, which leads to inconsistencies and increased deployment times. Additionally, the need for a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline has become critical to streamline our development process and ensure rapid delivery of features.

The initial setup lacks automation, making it difficult to manage changes and track infrastructure as code. The use of AWS services such as S3 for static website hosting, CloudFront for content delivery, and CodePipeline for CI/CD is essential for our project. The current manual processes are error-prone.

### Decision
We have decided to implement Terraform as our infrastructure as code (IaC) tool to automate the provisioning and management of our AWS resources. The following key components will be established:

1. **S3 Bucket for Website Hosting**: An S3 bucket will be created to host the static website, with configurations for public access and website hosting enabled.
2. **CloudFront Distribution**: A CloudFront distribution will be set up to serve the website with low latency and high transfer speeds, including custom error responses for single-page application (SPA) routing.
3. **ACM Certificate for HTTPS**: An ACM certificate will be provisioned to secure the website with HTTPS, ensuring data integrity and security for users.
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: A CodePipeline will be established to automate the build and deployment process, integrating with CodeBuild for building the application and deploying it to the S3 bucket.
5. **IAM Roles and Policies**: IAM roles and policies will be created to provide the necessary permissions for CodeBuild and CodePipeline to interact with AWS resources securely.

This decision will enable us to manage our infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner, while reducing deployment times and errors.

### Consequences
The implementation of Terraform and the associated AWS services will lead to several positive outcomes:

- **Increased Efficiency**: Automation of resource provisioning will significantly reduce the time required to set up and manage infrastructure.
- **Consistency**: Infrastructure as code ensures that environments are consistent across development, testing, and production, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Scalability**: The use of AWS services allows for easy scaling of resources as the project grows, accommodating increased traffic and user demand.
- **Improved Security**: The use of IAM roles and policies will enhance security by following the principle of least privilege, ensuring that services have only the permissions they need.
- **Faster Feedback Loop**: The CI/CD pipeline will enable rapid iterations and faster feedback on code changes, improving the overall development process.

However, there are also challenges to consider:

- **Learning Curve**: Team members may need time to become proficient with Terraform and AWS services.
- **Initial Setup Time**: The initial investment in setting up the infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline may require significant effort upfront.
